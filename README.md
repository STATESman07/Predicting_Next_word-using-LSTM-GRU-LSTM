# Predicting_Next_word-using-LSTM-GRU-LSTM
This project demonstrates the application of deep learning in natural language processing by building a Next Word Prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model is trained on the text of Shakespeareâ€™s Hamlet, which provides a linguistically rich and complex dataset, ideal for language modeling tasks.
